I would characterize his audio aura as being very intense, due to it's high energy avg, having a regular mood, due to it's valence avg being very close to the middle of the scale, and a lover of dance, due to it's danceability avg being pretty high.

The way i calculated this listener's aura might be innacuratte because the amount of time he spent listening to the songs is not available.

I'd propose counting the time the user has spent on every genre and song from his top 100, and then making a weighted average to have certain songs values to worth more or less on the aftermath.
