Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations many of the predictions were incorrect, for example in the 10 simulations experiment only 10 teams have a chance at winning the tournament which is completely incorrect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

after 10.000 simulations for two reasons:
1. This is using almost all of the second i'd have to pay for
2. The results are very similar to the ones of a more accurate research
